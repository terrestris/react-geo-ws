# react-geo components

Currently ({{ book.reactGeoVersion }}), react-geo provides a bunch of components that can be used for building Web-GIS applications.
For example:

- Buttons (e.g. to en/disable map interactions)
- CircleMenu
- NominatimSearch
- ScaleCombo
- PropertyGrid
- FeatureGrid
- LayerTree
- Legend
- MapComponent
- Panel / Window
- Slider (LayerTransparency)
- Toolbar
- AddWMS-Container
- Utils
  - GeometryUtil (topological operations)
  - FeatureUtil
  - MapUtil
- HigherOrderComponents
  - VisibleComponent
  - MapProvider

You find the full feature list (also containing future components) [here](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo/wiki/Feature-List).


In the following, we'll have a closer look at some components in detail and show how they can be used in combination.
